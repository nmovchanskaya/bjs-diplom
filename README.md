# Diploma project for course 'Basics of JavaScript'

This is a site for crypto-startup.
On this site we can buy internal currency of Netcoin, transfer this currency to other users of the service.
There is an interface for interacting with the API (backend, where transactions between user and funds take place), and an interface for interacting with the DOM (grafical interface, that you see in browser). And we have to connect these 2 parts: to do so, that the data entered by the user is sent to the server, and the information provided by the server is displayed to the user.

## Structure of the project

There are 2 pages in the project, that we have to do:

1. Page "Login and registration":
